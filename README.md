# Data-Driven-Model-Order-Reduction-with-POD-NN
Leakage Detection with Machine Learning! This project uses a POD-NN model to build a fast, data-driven surrogate for a water reservoir. I trained it on FEM simulations to quickly identify leakage location and size from sensor data, solving a complex inverse problem with an innovative ROM approach.
